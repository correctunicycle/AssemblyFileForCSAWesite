# Assembly Files For CSA Wesite
Example asssembly files for use with the pipelining website accessible here: https://csawebsite.herokuapp.com
The website will parse the assembly instructions out of the file, in order for it to do this the following formatting must be adhered to:
* Instructions separated from operands with a tab (Not spaces!)
* operands separated by a space

If these formatting rules are not adhered to the website will fail to parse the instructions correctly and produce incorrect output.


1. First ordered list item
2. Another item
⋅⋅* Unordered sub-list. 
1. Actual numbers don't matter, just that it's a number
⋅⋅1. Ordered sub-list
4. And another item.

⋅⋅⋅You can have properly indented paragraphs within list items. Notice the blank line above, and the leading spaces (at least one, but we'll use three here to also align the raw Markdown).

⋅⋅⋅To have a line break without a paragraph, you will need to use two trailing spaces.⋅⋅
⋅⋅⋅Note that this line is separate, but within the same paragraph.⋅⋅
⋅⋅⋅(This is contrary to the typical GFM line break behaviour, where trailing spaces are not required.)

* Unordered list can use asterisks
- Or minuses
+ Or pluses

# Assembly Files For CSA Wesite
Example asssembly files for use with the pipelining website accessible here: https://csawebsite.herokuapp.com
The website will parse the assembly instructions out of the file, in order for it to do this the following formatting must be adhered to:
*Instructions separated from operands with a tab (Not spaces!)
*operands separated by a space

If these formatting rules are not adhered to the website will fail to parse the instructions correctly and produce incorrect output.

 Markup : * Bullet list
              * Nested bullet
                  * Sub-nested bullet etc
          * Bullet list item 2

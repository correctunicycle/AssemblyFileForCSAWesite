# Assembly Files For CSA pipelining website
Example asssembly files for use with the pipelining website accessible here: https://csawebsite.herokuapp.com
The website will parse the assembly instructions out of the file, in order for it to do this the following formatting must be adhered to:
* Instructions separated from operands with a tab (Not spaces!)
* operands separated by a space

If these formatting rules are not adhered to the website will fail to parse the instructions correctly and produce incorrect output.
